# An Animal Crossing: New Horizon Unofficial Guide

## Description:
This is the beginning of an Animal Crossing Guide. Currently there's a home page that displays character's with birthdays on the current date. The villagers tab has a list of all of the villagers. And the Critterpedia tab has all bugs in the game with info about each. 

## Instructions:
On the Villagers tab, type in the name of a character in order to search or browse through the ones listed. Clicking on a card will take you to a page with more information about that character.

On the Critterpedia tab, there is a grid with the bugs avialable to catch in the game. This will display the time of year and location where you can catch each item. Currnently, blanks mean all year. Also, it is currently set up only to display northern hemisphere. Clicking on the grid headers will allow the page to sort by that category.

Clicking on a bug in the grid will add it to the favorites tab. On the left of the page in the side bar, clicking the button "favorites" will let you see any bugs selected. Clicking one of these bugs will remove it from your list. 

## Future Goals:
- [ ] Adding in fish and sea creatures
